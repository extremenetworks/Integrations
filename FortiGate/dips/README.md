* Regex for FortiGate v6: `devid="FGVMEV4L-TUFYM70".*srcip=$threatIpAddress.*action="deny".*policy$threatName\s`
Based on the FortiGate firewall settings the module can receive many syslog messages. It is very probable that customer will not want to Blacklist every device for each packet drop. Careful customization of the regex is recommended. The example above does match events from FortiGate with name `FGVMEV4L-TUFYM70`.
